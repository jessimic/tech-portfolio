title: Portrait of a Scientist

Portrait of a Scientist is a video montage series that aims to deconstruct stereotypes about what a scientist looks and acts like and demystify who can be a scientist. It relies on community submitted videos and images that complete the phrase "I am a scientist and I also..." Please help us show that anyone can be a scientist!
