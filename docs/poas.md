Portrait of a Scientist is a video montage series that aims to deconstruct stereotypes about what a scientist looks and acts like and demystify who can be a scientist. It relies on community submitted videos and images that complete the phrase "I am a scientist and I also..." Please help us show that anyone can be a scientist!

## Contribute ##

Note that these contributions will be shared on social media and that that each submission will be included at the project manager's discretion. 

### Personal Contribution ###

There are many ways to contribute, with the theme of finishing the phrase "I am a _______ [STEM position or field of study] and I also __________". [Submit here](https://tiny.cc/POAS)

1. Submit a photo of yourself (can be old or new), include your phrase in the comments box of the submission form or write it on your picture yourself!
2. Submit a photo of yourself holding your phrase on a sign--you can also print our templates!(see below)
3. Submit a video of yourself saying the phrase (props welcome but not necessary).

The phrase is open ended, so you can feel free to talk about a hobby, place of origin, cultural identity, religion, race, gender, sexuality, other roles (ie. mother, father, caretaker, etc.), anything else you want to share! You can also submit one or many!

### Group Contribution ###

Want to gather responses at your own institution/collaboration/conference? Download the templates and have them available for people to complete! Send me the pictures of the result and I will edit into a video and collage for distribution.
